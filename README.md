# Introduction to HTML Editing with Github

Github is a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and it can be used for coding a variety of programming languages.  In addition, we can use it to create pages in HTML.  Before we begin, we will need to install a few extensions to help us out

# Extensions
Open up the *Extensions* from the activity bar. This functions like the Google Chrome Extension marketplace where you can add extensions to customize VSC or add functionality for specific languages.
We will be installing the following extensions for use with this unit on HTML:
1. Beautify
2. Preview in browser
3. Live Server

Note that every extension has settings that you should review when you are installing them to make sure that they are correct for you.  Preview in browser, for example needs to have the correct browser (or default browser) identifed

# Beautify
Source code is the stuff you type in to make something work.  We will consider even the stuff you need to make html documents work as source code.  Often source code is very difficult to read, but by organizing the contents, it is often easier to understand.

```
Once you have installed the extensions, open the "page1.html" document.
Use F1 to show all available commands, and type "beautify"
Your code should be more nicely organized!
There are numerous extensions that will do something similar, and several that will work for other tasks
```
 **When you look at the page1.html document, you will notice many words that are included within the <> symbols.  These are used to denote markup tags in HTML**

# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is not really a computer programming language, but it is a way of "marking up" content and flag it for 'formatting'. You might consider looking up LaTEX, which was for typesetting documents before modern computing.

Discord incorporates elements from a markup language called *Markdown* to format text in posts.

Github has its own formatting language that can be used in its README.md files
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax


 HTML uses *tags* to identify sections of text to be marked up.  These use beginning tags and ending tags.  We sometimes call these "container" tags, because the text to be formatted is contained between the beginning and ending.

 ```
 Read about HTML elements/tags at https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp
 In particular, pay attention to the following sections:
 HTML Basic - for the structure (similar to what we have in page1.html)
 HTML Elements - to learn about nesting HTML elements and the end tags
 HTML Attributes - to find out about adding more detail to a tag
 HTML Formatting - to learn about some of the early formatting tags
 HTML Images - to learn about how to add a picture to a webpage
 
 Visit: https://www.techonthenet.com/html/elements/font_tag.php to learn about the font tag

 Note: The font tag is really old technology that has since been replaced by styles. We will be looking at styles a bit later, but this provides some context for where HTML used to be and why styles has gradually become the new standard for formatting html

 We will also look at HTML Tables a bit later, but these give us enough to get started

It is a good idea to include all the resouces (including graphics files) that you will need in your working directory.  We have included some that you can use for today's assignment.

* napi.jpg
* unnamed.jpg

# Assignment:
Use basic formatting tags to modify the napi.html story to make it more interesting to look at.  You can experiment with several of the different tags.
You should have paragraphs, different colors and formatting, as well as headings.  You should use the img tag to include the images that have been provided.
You must include examples of nested tags as well.
